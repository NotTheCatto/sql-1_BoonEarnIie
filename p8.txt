CREATE INDEX idx_dept
ON employees (department);

/*
1. The department column is selected since it is potentially queried more often compared to the salary column.
2. Indexed columns take longer to update and since salary updates more frequently because of pay raises and cuts, it is not suitable to be indexed.
